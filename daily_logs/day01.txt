#Creating the first log (Day 1)

I will start going over the book Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python 
by Al Sweigart. This book will teach me how a game is broken into state, logic,
players, turns, and such...

By working through the examples of the book, I will try to adapt its patterns,
applying what I learn to the board game I am also trying to simulate in Python.

Important Chapters to focus on today will be Chapter 1, The Interactive Shell,
and Chapter 2, Writing Programs. I will go up to Chapter 16 of the book. But,
if anything else is needed to improve the board game somehow, I will go over 
the other remaining chapters to see what can be used.
